# Hackathon Design & Facilitation (2 hours)

## **Overview**

**Aim**: Build and showcase AI solutions that solve real business problems and highlight the value of AI adoption.
**Context**: 25 eBay ambassadors will form cross-functional teams to develop prototypes based on the use cases identified earlier.

---

## **Objectives**

By the end of the hackathon, participants will:

* Build simple but functional AI prototypes.
* Demonstrate collaboration across departments.
* Present the business value of AI solutions in a clear, engaging way.
* Identify next steps for scaling promising ideas.

---

## **Structure**

### **1. Kickoff & Team Formation (20 mins)**

* Form teams of 4–5 with a mix of departments.
* Choose one use case from your shortlist.
* Define the problem clearly and set 1–2 success metrics.
* Output: Problem statement + success measure.

---

### **2. Build & Prototype (60 mins)**

* Use rapid prototyping approaches (mockups, workflows, Custom GPTs, quick automations).
* Focus on **functionality that demonstrates value**, not polish.
* Coaches will circulate to unblock and prompt.
* Output: A working demo or mockup that addresses your use case.

---

### **3. Pitch Prep (10 mins)**

* Create a simple 3-slide deck or demo script:

  1. Problem
  2. Solution
  3. Impact + Next Steps
* Practice a short 3-minute pitch.

---

### **4. Presentations & Feedback (25 mins)**

* Each team presents for 3 minutes + 1 minute Q&A.
* Format: Problem → Solution → Demo → Impact.
* Audience: peers + facilitators.
* Feedback: quick peer voting and reflections.

---

### **5. Wrap & Next Steps (5 mins)**

* Celebrate wins and highlight standout ideas.
* Reinforce: this is a **starting point**, not the finish line.
* Share how top projects can be supported and scaled.

---

## **Judging Criteria (simple version)**

* **Business Value** → Does it solve a real problem?
* **Functionality** → Does it work in a demo?
* **User Experience** → Is it usable/clear?
* **Presentation** → Is the value communicated well?

---

## **Facilitation Tips**

* Keep energy high — use countdown timers and music between phases.
* Remind teams: done is better than perfect.
* Use prompts if teams get stuck: *“What’s the smallest version you could demo?”*
* Encourage storytelling in pitches — not just features.

---

## **Materials Needed**

* Access to AI tools (ChatGPT Enterprise, Custom GPTs, etc.).
* Collaboration tools (Slides, Figma, Airtable — optional).
* Presentation equipment (screen, projector).
* Timers and voting forms.

---

## **Success Markers**

* Every team has a working demo or mockup.
* Clear link between problem and AI solution.
* Visible collaboration across departments.
* Practical ideas surfaced for follow-up after the hackathon.
