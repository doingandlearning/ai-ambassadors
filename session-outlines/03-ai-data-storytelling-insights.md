Perfect ‚Äî thanks for pasting the full storytelling session. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd **pick and mix** between what you drafted and what we explored in the chat, and shape it into a **tight, energising 2-hour block**. I‚Äôve dropped what feels duplicative, kept the high-value interactive pieces, and integrated the practical cautions/insights we discussed (AI‚Äôs role vs Excel, complexity/volume of data, transparency, iteration, etc.).

# **AI Data Storytelling & Insights (2 hours)**

## **Aim**

Help ambassadors transform AI outputs and datasets into compelling, decision-ready narratives that inspire confidence and action.

---

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

* Apply data visualisation best practices (with and without AI).
* Use storytelling frameworks tuned for different audiences.
* Translate technical AI insights into plain, actionable language.
* Recognise when AI adds value vs. when manual analysis suffices.

---

## **Session Flow (2h)**

### 1. **Opening & Framing (10 mins)**

* Why stories matter more than charts: decisions follow narratives, not raw numbers.
* Quick pair reflection: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the hardest part of presenting data to your team/leadership?‚Äù
  - Think/Pair/Share
* Pull out themes (confidence, clarity, trust).

---

### 2. **Chart Selection Challenge (30 mins)**

* **Mini-input (10 mins):** Principles of clarity, context, colour, simplicity.
* **Activity (15 mins):** Groups get 4‚Äì5 mock datasets (generated beforehand).

  * Task: choose the best visualisation and explain *why*.
  * AI twist: try the same with ChatGPT/GPT-powered tool ‚Üí compare.
* **Debrief (5 mins):** Where did AI help (speed, alternatives, inspiration)? Where did Excel/manual still feel easier?

üëâ Key learning: AI is a partner for speed, pattern-spotting, and ideation ‚Äî not a replacement for judgment.

---

### 3. **Storytelling Frameworks (25 mins)**

* Introduce the **Data Story Arc**: Setup ‚Üí Conflict ‚Üí Resolution ‚Üí Impact.
* Map to audiences (Leadership = ROI, Teams = workflow, Technical = methods, Non-technical = outcomes).
* **Exercise:** Each table takes the *same dataset insight*, reframes it for a different audience.
* Peer feedback: which framing felt clear/compelling?

---

### 4. **AI as Coach & Assistant (20 mins)**

* Demo/worked example:

  * Upload messy dataset ‚Üí ask GPT to summarise, suggest charts, explain reasoning.
  * Iteration loop: tweak prompts, refine outputs, ask ‚ÄúWhy this?‚Äù
* Discuss:

  * Transparency (‚Äúexplain your reasoning‚Äù).
  * Iteration ‚Üí final polish in Excel/PowerPoint.
  * Limits (large datasets ‚Üí chunk, code assist, not whole dump).

---

### 5. **Translating Data for Non-Technical Audiences (20 mins)**

* **Mini-input:** Four techniques: analogies, plain language, visual aids, uncertainty framing.
* **Activity:** Pairs take a technical AI output (prepped example) and explain it to a ‚Äúnon-technical stakeholder.‚Äù
* Swap roles, then share the best metaphors/phrases in plenary.

---

### 6. **Wrap-Up & Action Planning (15 mins)**

* Group reflection: ‚ÄúOne way I‚Äôll use AI differently in my next presentation is‚Ä¶‚Äù
* Capture on sticky notes/flip chart for collective takeaway.
* Preview: These skills feed directly into **use case development** and **hackathon pitches**.

---

## **Materials Needed**

* Mock datasets (CSV or Sheets).
* Pre-generated ‚ÄúAI draft charts‚Äù for comparison.
* Flip chart & sticky notes.
* Slide deck with principles + frameworks.
* Access to GPT tool for demo.

---

## **Why This Blend Works**

* Keeps **energy balanced**: on feet for chart challenge, sitting for frameworks, small-group practice for translation.
* Anchors AI as **accelerator + coach**, not magic black box.
* Directly builds the four learning objectives without overload.
* Leaves them with practical outputs: ‚ÄúCharting playbook,‚Äù ‚ÄúAudience framing tips,‚Äù ‚ÄúTranslation metaphors.‚Äù
