# GROW Model ‚Äì Talking Points

### Intro / Why it matters**

* GROW is a simple, practical coaching framework.
* It keeps you from jumping straight into ‚Äúsolution mode.‚Äù
* Especially useful in AI adoption, where colleagues may feel stuck, overwhelmed, or sceptical.

---

### G = Goal - Clarifying what they want**

* *‚ÄúWhat does AI success look like for you or your team?‚Äù*
* Goals should be **specific, relevant, and achievable soon** (not grand 5-year visions).
* Examples: ‚ÄúUse AI to draft first-pass reports‚Äù / ‚ÄúAutomate 2 manual tasks this month.‚Äù

- Scaling Question: ‚ÄúOn a scale of 1‚Äì10, where are you now? What would a 7 look like?‚Äù
- Future Pacing: ‚ÄúImagine it‚Äôs 3 months from now and this worked ‚Äî what‚Äôs different?‚Äù
- Magic Wand / Miracle Question: ‚ÄúIf you could wave a wand, what outcome would you see?‚Äù
- SMART filter: Test if their goal is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
- Reframe big goals ‚Üí small steps: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a first win that proves progress?‚Äù

---

### **3. R = Reality - Understand the starting point**

* *‚ÄúWhere are you starting from?‚Äù*
* Explore their current context: knowledge, skills, workflows, blockers.
* Example questions:

  * ‚ÄúWhat have you already tried with AI?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWhat worked well or not?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWhat resources do you have?‚Äù

- Continuum Walk: Literally ask them to place themselves along a line from ‚Äúnot at all‚Äù to ‚Äúvery confident/experienced.‚Äù
- Evidence Gathering: ‚ÄúWhat data or examples show where you are now?‚Äù
- Strengths Inventory: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs already working that you can build on?‚Äù
- Obstacle Spotting: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs slowing you down most right now?‚Äù
- Day-in-the-life Probe: Walk through how their current workflow actually looks.

---

### **4. O = Options - Generate possibilities**

* *‚ÄúWhat could you try?‚Äù* ‚Äî brainstorm, don‚Äôt prescribe.
* Encourage multiple ideas ‚Äî even if rough.
* Example questions:

  * ‚ÄúWhat small experiments could you run?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWho else could you learn from?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWhat AI tools might help?‚Äù

- Brainstorm Blitz: List as many ideas as possible in 2 minutes ‚Äî no judging.
- Third-Person Flip: ‚ÄúIf a colleague came to you with this, what would you suggest?‚Äù
- Best/Worst/Most Practical: Name one bold, one risky, and one practical option.
- Constraint Reversal: ‚ÄúIf time/resources weren‚Äôt a problem, what would you try?‚Äù
- Past Success Mining: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs worked in a similar situation before?‚Äù

---

### **5. W = Will - Commit to action**

* *‚ÄúWhat will you do?‚Äù* ‚Äî convert options into action.
* Commit to **one small, time-bound step**.
* Example prompts:

  * ‚ÄúWhich option feels doable this week?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your next experiment?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúHow will you know you‚Äôve made progress?‚Äù

- Next Step Question: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the very first thing you‚Äôll do?‚Äù
- Accountability Buddy: Pair them with someone to check progress.
- If‚ÄìThen Planning: ‚ÄúIf I get stuck, then I will‚Ä¶‚Äù
- Obstacle Pre-mortem: ‚ÄúWhat could stop you, and how will you handle it?‚Äù
- Scaling to Action: ‚ÄúOn a scale of 1‚Äì10, how likely are you to do this? What makes it a 7 instead of a 5?‚Äù

---

### **6. Wrap-Up / Coaching Angle**

* GROW keeps the **ownership with them**, not you.
* Your role as coach: ask, listen, reflect back, encourage.
* It builds confidence because they generate their own path.
üëâ The key principle across all: make it tangible, make it theirs.
You‚Äôre guiding with structure, not giving answers.

# AI Adoption Journey ‚Äì Speaking Notes (7 mins)

### **Frame the Model (1 min)**

* Just like any change, AI adoption isn‚Äôt one leap ‚Äî it‚Äôs a journey.
* Think of it as moving through stages. Our job as coaches is to notice where someone is, and meet them there.
* You don‚Äôt try to drag someone from Awareness straight to Advocacy ‚Äî you help them take the *next step*.

---

### **Stage 1: Awareness (1 min)**

* *Definition:* They‚Äôve heard of AI, but may not know what it actually does.
* *eBay example:* ‚ÄúA seller hearing about generative AI but assuming it only writes poetry.‚Äù
* *Coaching move:* Give simple, relatable examples ‚Äî e.g. AI drafting a product description.

---

### **Stage 2: Interest (1 min)**

* *Definition:* Curiosity is sparked, they want to learn more.
* *eBay example:* ‚ÄúA marketing colleague asking if AI could help speed up campaign brainstorming.‚Äù
* *Coaching move:* Encourage safe exploration ‚Äî point them to a simple use case or demo.

---

### **Stage 3: Trial (1‚Äì1.5 mins)**

* *Definition:* First hands-on attempts, often clunky or frustrating.
* *eBay example:* ‚ÄúA finance teammate pasting numbers into ChatGPT to summarise, but not sure if they can trust it.‚Äù
* *Coaching move:* Normalise awkward first steps, celebrate small wins, share simple prompting tips.

---

### **Stage 4: Adoption (1‚Äì1.5 mins)**

* *Definition:* Regular use in their daily workflow. AI is becoming habit.
* *eBay example:* ‚ÄúCustomer service using an AI draft to respond to enquiries before personalising.‚Äù
* *Coaching move:* Reinforce value, surface new opportunities, connect them to peers at the same level.

---

### **Stage 5: Advocacy (1 min)**

* *Definition:* They‚Äôve had success, now they‚Äôre teaching others.
* *eBay example:* ‚ÄúA designer showing their team how AI helped generate prototype variations.‚Äù
* *Coaching move:* Encourage sharing stories, create spaces for them to showcase wins, link them to leadership channels.

---

### **Closing Thought**

* ‚ÄúThe adoption journey is about progression, not perfection. Coaching is helping people take the *next step forward* from wherever they are.‚Äù

---



* **Paired micro-practice:** Each person coaches their partner on a simple ‚ÄúHow could AI help in your week?‚Äù using GROW (10 mins)

---

### 3. Handling Resistance & Skepticism (25 minutes)

* Resistance is normal in any change process; with AI it often shows up in familiar patterns.

-> Gather objections folks have encountered

* The five most common objections:
  * Fear of job loss
  * Feeling not technical enough
  * Belief that AI is too complex
  * Lack of trust in AI outputs
  * Lack of time to learn or experiment
* Our role as coaches is not to crush resistance but to engage with it constructively.
* Effective strategies include:
  * Acknowledge concerns so people feel heard.
  * Reframe AI as a tool that enhances rather than replaces.
  * Provide evidence or examples of safe, successful adoption.
  * Start with small, low-risk, high-value use cases.
  * Offer ongoing support and reassurance ‚Äî adoption is a journey, not a one-off.

### Kagan Carousel - Stay and Stray


### Debrief

* Capture standout phrases on flip chart under a ‚ÄúResistance Playbook‚Äù heading.
* Reinforce that ambassadors can use this as a living resource back in their teams.

### 4. Real-World Coaching Scenarios (30 minutes)

* **Set-up (3 mins):**
