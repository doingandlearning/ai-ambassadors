# Confidence Continuum – Facilitator’s Guide (10–12 mins)

### **1. Set-Up (1–2 mins)**

* Invite participants to stand along a line from *“Not confident at all”* → *“Very confident”*.
* Frame it as: *“This is about where you feel right now, not forever. There’s no right or wrong place.”*

---

### **2. Opening Exploration (2–3 mins)**

* Start with a few individuals:

  * *“Why did you choose to stand here rather than there?”*
  * *“What does this position represent for you?”*
* Encourage short answers — the aim is to surface perspectives, not deep stories yet.

---

### **3. Strengths & Assets (2–3 mins)**

Shift the energy so it’s not all deficit/barrier talk.

* *“What strengths are you already bringing to this role?”*
* *“When have you successfully coached or supported someone before?”*
* *“What’s one thing you already do well that will help you as an ambassador?”*

---

### **4. Barriers & Needs (2–3 mins)**

Now open the space for challenge.

* *“What’s holding you back from being further along the line?”*
* *“What would you need to see or experience to feel more comfortable?”*
* *“If you could wave a magic wand, what would make you feel more confident?”*

Capture 2–3 responses on a flip chart.

### **5. Peer Learning & Group Dynamics (2 mins)**

* *“Look around — what do you notice about where people are standing?”*
* *“If you’re further along, what helped you get there? If you’re earlier, what could you learn from those people?”*
* *“What’s one shared challenge across the continuum?”*

---

### **6. Future Focus (1–2 mins)**

Close by pointing forward.

* *“By the end of this session, where would you like to be standing?”*
* *“What would success look like for you as an AI coach?”*
* *“What’s one small step you could take today to move forward?”*

---

* **Don’t overfix.** Stay in curiosity, not solution mode — that comes later in frameworks/resistance sections.
