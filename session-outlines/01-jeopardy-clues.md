## **AI Basics**

* **100**: This is the broad field of building systems that perform tasks requiring human intelligence.
  *Answer: What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?*
* **200**: This is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed.
  *Answer: What is Machine Learning (ML)?*
* **300**: This branch of AI creates new content like text, images, or audio.
  *Answer: What is Generative AI (GenAI)?*
* **400**: ChatGPT is an example of this type of model trained on huge text datasets.
  *Answer: What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?*
* **500**: These layered systems of connected nodes are inspired by the structure of the human brain.
  *Answer: What is a Neural Network?*

## **Technical Terms**

* **100**: This is the instruction you give to an AI model to get a response.
  *Answer: What is a Prompt?*
* **200**: This defines the maximum amount of text a model can “see” at once.
  *Answer: What is a Context Window?*
* **300**: Models break text into these small units, usually a few characters or words at a time.
  *Answer: What is a Token?*
* **400**: This process adapts a pre-trained model to a specific dataset or task.
  *Answer: What is Fine-tuning?*
* **500**: These numerical vectors capture the meaning of text for tasks like search and clustering.
  *Answer: What are Embeddings?*

## **AI in Practice**

* **100**: eBay uses this type of system to suggest products you might want to buy.
  *Answer: What is a Recommendation System?*
* **200**: This field helps computers understand and generate human language.
  *Answer: What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?*
* **300**: This type of AI can act on instructions, making decisions and carrying out steps.
  *Answer: What is an Agent?*
* **400**: Using AI to handle repetitive tasks across apps and services is called this.
  *Answer: What is Workflow Automation?*
* **500**: AlphaGo used this approach, where models learn through trial, error, and reward.
  *Answer: What is Reinforcement Learning?*

## **Model Behaviour**

* **100**: When a model makes up information that isn’t true, it’s called this.
  *Answer: What is Hallucination?*
* **200**: When training data skews results toward one group, this issue appears.
  *Answer: What is Bias?*
* **300**: Treating different groups equitably in AI outcomes relates to this principle.
  *Answer: What is Fairness?*
* **400**: This quality means we can understand how and why a model made a decision.
  *Answer: What is Explainability?*
* **500**: When a model’s process and limitations are open to inspection, it shows this.
  *Answer: What is Transparency?*

## **Responsible Use**

* **100**: Protecting sensitive customer information relates to this concept.
  *Answer: What is Data Privacy?*
* **200**: Adding this ensures humans remain part of AI decision-making.
  *Answer: What is Human-in-the-loop?*
* **300**: Before deploying an AI system, companies should perform this to identify potential harms.
  *Answer: What is Risk Assessment?*
* **400**: Regulatory bodies or internal committees provide this to ensure AI is used responsibly.
  *Answer: What is Oversight?*
* **500**: These boundaries are set to prevent misuse and ensure AI operates safely.
  *Answer: What are Guardrails?*
