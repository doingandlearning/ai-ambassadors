# AI Coaching for Ambassadors

- <span class="fragment">Aim: equip ambassadors to coach AI adoption confidently</span>
- <span class="fragment">Arc: Frameworks → Resistance → Real coaching → Skill levels → Action</span>

<!-- Note:
Open with energy. Set expectations: this is hands-on and coaching-first. -->

---

## Confidence Scale

> How confident are you in coaching about AI today?

---

### Coaching vs Training vs Mentoring

- <span class="fragment"><b>Training:</b> Knowledge transfer – "Here's how to do X"</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Mentoring:</b> Experience sharing – "When I faced this..."</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Coaching:</b> Question-led discovery – "What do you think would work?"</span>

---

To do this well, we'll need:

- <span class="fragment">Tools or frameworks to help us</span>
- <span class="fragment">Confidence to engage with resistance</span>
- <span class="fragment">Real life practice</span>

<!-- Note:
Mark one wall “low confidence”, opposite “high”. Debrief with 2–3 voices across the spectrum. -->

---

## Self-Assessment Prompts

- <span class="fragment">Current coaching experience & comfort</span>
- <span class="fragment">Biggest challenges supporting colleagues</span>
- <span class="fragment">Dept-specific barriers to AI adoption</span>

<!-- Note:
Quick written reflection; collect later for follow-up resources. -->

---

## Coaching Frameworks

- <span class="fragment">GROW for AI: Goal → Reality → Options → Will</span>
- <span class="fragment">AI Adoption Journey: Awareness → Interest → Trial → Adoption → Advocacy</span>
- <span class="fragment">Micro-practice: “How could AI help this week?” (pairs)</span>

<!-- Note:
Keep theory <10m. Then 5m each way in pairs using GROW. -->

---

## GROW Model – AI Coaching Framework

- <span class="fragment"><b>G</b>oal: What does AI success look like for you?</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>R</b>eality: Where are you starting from?</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>O</b>ptions: What could you try?</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>W</b>ill: What will you do?</span>

<!-- Note:
Keeps ownership with them, not you. Ask, listen, reflect back, encourage. -->

---

## G = Goal – Clarifying what they want

**Aim:** Specific, relevant, achievable soon (not grand 5-year visions)

- <span class="fragment">"What does AI success look like for you or your team?"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"On a scale of 1–10, where are you now? What would a 7 look like?"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"If you could wave a wand, what outcome would you see?"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"What's a first win that proves progress?"</span>

---

## R = Reality – Understand the starting point

**Aim:** Explore current context: knowledge, skills, workflows, blockers

- <span class="fragment">"What have you already tried with AI?"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"What worked well or not?"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"What's already working that you can build on?"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"What's slowing you down most right now?"</span>

---

## O = Options – Generate possibilities

**Aim:** Brainstorm, don't prescribe. Encourage multiple ideas

- <span class="fragment">"What small experiments could you run?"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"Who else could you learn from?"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"If time/resources weren't a problem, what would you try?"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"What's worked in a similar situation before?"</span>

---

## W = Will – Commit to action

**Aim:** Convert options into one small, time-bound step

- <span class="fragment">"Which option feels doable this week?"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"What's the very first thing you'll do?"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"How will you know you've made progress?"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"What could stop you, and how will you handle it?"</span>

## AI Adoption Journey – 5 Stages

- <span class="fragment"><b>Awareness:</b> They've heard of AI, but may not know what it actually does</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Interest:</b> Curiosity is sparked, they want to learn more</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Trial:</b> First hands-on attempts, often clunky or frustrating</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Adoption:</b> Regular use in their daily workflow. AI is becoming habit</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Advocacy:</b> They've had success, now they're teaching others</span>

<!-- Note:
Our job: notice where someone is, meet them there, help them take the next step. -->

---

## Stage 1: Awareness

**Definition:** They've heard of AI, but may not know what it actually does

**eBay Example:** "A seller hearing about generative AI but assuming it only writes poetry"

**Coaching Move:** Give simple, relatable examples — e.g. AI drafting a product description

---

## Stage 2: Interest

**Definition:** Curiosity is sparked, they want to learn more

**eBay Example:** "A marketing colleague asking if AI could help speed up campaign brainstorming"

**Coaching Move:** Encourage safe exploration — point them to a simple use case or demo

---

## Stage 3: Trial

**Definition:** First hands-on attempts, often clunky or frustrating

**eBay Example:** "A finance teammate pasting numbers into ChatGPT to summarise, but not sure if they can trust it"

**Coaching Move:** Normalise awkward first steps, celebrate small wins, share simple prompting tips

---

## Stage 4: Adoption

**Definition:** Regular use in their daily workflow. AI is becoming habit

**eBay Example:** "Customer service using an AI draft to respond to enquiries before personalising"

**Coaching Move:** Reinforce value, surface new opportunities, connect them to peers at the same level

---

## Stage 5: Advocacy

**Definition:** They've had success, now they're teaching others

**eBay Example:** "A designer showing their team how AI helped generate prototype variations"

**Coaching Move:** Encourage sharing stories, create spaces for them to showcase wins, link them to leadership channels


---

## Pair Practice – GROW in Action

- <span class="fragment">Find someone near you</span>
- <span class="fragment">One is **coach**, one is **coachee** (swap halfway)</span>
- <span class="fragment">Coachee: share a small work challenge where AI *might* help</span>
- <span class="fragment">Coach: use GROW questions to guide the conversation</span>
- <span class="fragment">5 minutes each, then swap</span>

<!-- Note:
Keep this light. Emphasise: this is practice, not perfection. 
Coaches should focus on *asking*, not *answering*. -->


---

## Coaching Prompts (use if stuck)

- <span class="fragment"><b>Goal:</b> "What would good look like?"</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Reality:</b> "What have you tried so far?"</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Options:</b> "What else could you experiment with?"</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Will:</b> "What’s one step you could take this week?"</span>

<!-- Note:
Offer these as safety rails — they don’t need to cover every letter in 5 minutes.
The aim is to feel the *flow of coaching*, not to nail the full model. -->

---

## Debrief – What Did You Notice?

- <span class="fragment">How did it feel to be coached vs to coach?</span>
- <span class="fragment">What questions unlocked the most insight?</span>
- <span class="fragment">What got in the way?</span>
- <span class="fragment">Where did you want to jump in with advice?</span>

---

## Handling Resistance

> Think of a time when someone pushed back on AI. What did they say? 

---

## Top patterns

- Fear of job loss
- Not feeling technical enough
- Belief that AI is too technical
- Lack of trust in AI outputs
- Lack of time to experiment or learn

## Handling Resistance
### Think/Pair/Share

> <span class="fragment">What challenges or concerns about AI adoption do your teams raise?</span>

<!-- Note:
Give each round a single objection. Rotate every ~3–4 minutes. -->

---

## Response Strategies

- <span class="fragment"><b>Acknowledge</b> before advising</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Normalise:</b>natural response</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Reframe:</b> AI as tool, not replacement</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Redirect to Values/Goals:</b> how does this tie back </span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Scale down:</b> low-risk, high-value use cases</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Co-create:</b> check-ins & office hours</span>

<!-- Note:
Capture standout lines on a flip chart verbatim. -->

## Real-World Coaching (Triads)

- <span class="fragment">Bring a live AI adoption challenge</span>
- <span class="fragment">Triads: Coach · Coachee · Observer</span>
- <span class="fragment">2 min share → 4 min coach → 2 min feedback</span>
- <span class="fragment">Harvest: “Power questions”</span>

<!-- Note:
Timebox strictly; circulate and model one powerful question per group. -->

---

## Power Questions (Examples)

- <span class="fragment">What outcome matters most this week?</span>
- <span class="fragment">What’s the smallest safe experiment?</span>
- <span class="fragment">What would make this 20% easier?</span>
- <span class="fragment">What risks do we want to avoid—and how?</span>
- <span class="fragment">How will we know it worked?</span>

<!-- Note:
Invite groups to add their best question to the wall. -->

---

- <span class="fragment"><b>Beginner:</b> quick wins, templates, high support</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Intermediate:</b> experiments, workflow chaining</span>
- <span class="fragment"><b>Advanced:</b> integration, sharing practices</span>

<!-- Note:
Ask each table for one tactic per level; record on flip chart. -->

---

## Confidence-Building Techniques

- <span class="fragment">Progressive disclosure (add complexity gradually)</span>
- <span class="fragment">Peer learning & showcases</span>
- <span class="fragment">Safe experimentation norms</span>
- <span class="fragment">Celebrate small wins</span>

<!-- Note:
Prompt them to schedule a 10-minute weekly “show & tell”. -->

---

## 1:50–2:10 Paired Coaching (Dept Context)

- <span class="fragment">Pair by proximity/department</span>
- <span class="fragment">Round 1: 5 min coach</span>
- <span class="fragment">Round 2: swap roles (5 min)</span>
- <span class="fragment">Share one technique that boosted confidence</span>

<!-- Note:
If uneven, allow cross-dept pairs; focus on questions, not answers. -->
