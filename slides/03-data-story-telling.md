# AI Data Storytelling & Insights
## Transforming data into narratives that inspire action

<!-- 
Aim: Build confidence presenting AI insights so they land with teams and leadership.
-->

---

## Learning Objectives
- <span class="fragment">Apply visualisation best practices (with & without AI)</span>  
- <span class="fragment">Use storytelling frameworks tuned for audiences</span>  
- <span class="fragment">Translate technical AI outputs into plain language</span>  
- <span class="fragment">Recognise when AI adds value vs manual analysis</span>  

---

## Opening Reflection
What’s the hardest part of presenting data at work?

<!-- 
Prompt pairs: Confidence? Clarity? Trust? Pull themes into plenary.
-->

---

## Why Storytelling?
- <span class="fragment">Decisions follow narratives, not numbers</span>  
- <span class="fragment">Charts need context, not just polish</span>  
- <span class="fragment">Stories turn insights into action</span>  

---

## Chart Principles
- **Clarity** – right chart type  
- **Context** – comparisons and background  
- **Colour** – highlight, don’t distract  
- **Simplicity** – strip clutter  

---

## Chart Challenge with AI Support
### Pick a dataset 
- Choose the best visualisation  
- Explain your choice  
- Optional: Ask AI to recommend a chart  
- Compare results  

---

## Debrief
- Where did AI help?  
- Where was manual still easier?  
- What surprised you?  

---

## The Data Story Arc
- **Setup** → situation  
- **Conflict** → problem  
- **Resolution** → how AI helps  
- **Impact** → results + benefits  

---

## Audience Adaptation
- **Leadership** → ROI, strategy, competition  
- **Teams** → workflow, daily benefits  
- **Technical** → methods, quality, implementation  
- **Non-technical** → outcomes, experience, value  

---

## Exercise: Reframe for Audience
- Same dataset insight → different audience  
- Adapt style, focus, and language  
- Peer feedback: which was clearest?  

---

## AI throughout the storytelling process
- Summarise messy data  
- Suggest charts  
- Explain reasoning  
- Iterate prompts → refine outputs  

---

## Demo Loop
**Prompt → Draft → Refine → Human Judgment**

<!-- 
Show: messy dataset → GPT summary → AI chart recs → refine → export to Excel/PowerPoint.
-->

---

## Translating Data
- **Analogies** – make it relatable  
- **Plain language** – no jargon  
- **Visual aids** – show patterns  
- **Uncertainty framing** – “confidence, not certainty”  

---

## Pair Practice
Take a technical AI output → explain it to a non-technical stakeholder.  
Swap roles.  
Share best metaphors/phrases with the group.  

---

## Wrap-Up
- One way I’ll use AI differently in my next presentation is…
