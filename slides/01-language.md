# AI Language Level Setting
<small>Establishing a shared baseline for AI communication</small>

- <span class="fragment">Shared vocabulary matters across teams</span>
- <span class="fragment">We’ll use your app, peer teaching, and games</span>
- <span class="fragment">Aim: clarity, confidence, and consistency</span>

<!--
Open with energy. Frame: this is about having a common language so we can coach others.
-->

---

## Session Objectives

- <span class="fragment">Use consistent AI terminology</span>
- <span class="fragment">Distinguish myths from realities</span>
- <span class="fragment">Apply “when / when not” frameworks</span>
- <span class="fragment">Communicate AI clearly to non-technical colleagues</span>

<!--
Check relevance with the group; nods or quick poll.
-->

---

## Openig

- <span class="fragment">Why shared language matters for eBay’s AI adoption</span>
- <span class="fragment">Quick intros: name · department · AI familiarity</span>
- <span class="fragment">Overview of session flow</span>

<!--
Keep intros tight; get 2–3 quick shares on “where language gets in the way”.
-->

---

## Vocabulary App

- <span class="fragment">Open the app on your phone</span>
- <span class="fragment">Categorise: Never heard · Heard · Could explain</span>

<!--
Give ~3 minutes for everyone to do this quietly.
-->

---

## Have a wander 

- <span class="fragment">Find peers who can explain your starred terms</span>
- <span class="fragment">Trade simple, plain-language explanations</span>

<!--
Give 7–8 minutes. Encourage examples, not jargon.
-->

---

## Group Pull-Back

- <span class="fragment">Which terms kept coming up as tricky?</span>
- <span class="fragment">What explanations worked best?</span>
- <span class="fragment">Agree on 2–3 “shared” definitions</span>

<!--
Facilitate. Capture 2–3 words on flip chart. Don’t solve them all.
-->

# AI Jeopardy
<small>Switch to the Jeopardy deck now</small>

- <span class="fragment">AI Basics</span>
- <span class="fragment">eBay Use Cases</span>
- <span class="fragment">When NOT to Use AI</span>
- <span class="fragment">Technical Terms</span>
- <span class="fragment">Ethics & Responsibility</span>

<!--
Explain rules briefly. Tables = teams. First to 1000 or time limit.
-->

---

## When to Use AI

- <span class="fragment">Good data available</span>
- <span class="fragment">Task is repetitive or text-heavy</span>
- <span class="fragment">Low-risk, human oversight possible</span>
- <span class="fragment">Clear cost-benefit</span>

---

## When Not to Use AI

- <span class="fragment">High-stakes or safety-critical decisions</span>
- <span class="fragment">Tasks requiring nuanced human judgment</span>
- <span class="fragment">Ambiguous or poor-quality data</span>
- <span class="fragment">Ethically sensitive areas</span>

---

## Common Misconceptions

- <span class="fragment">Bigger models are always better</span>
- <span class="fragment">Prompting skill replaces domain expertise</span>
- <span class="fragment">AI is unbiased because it’s data-driven</span>
- <span class="fragment">Automation always means job loss</span>

<!--
Keep this 8–10 minutes. Lower energy a little, make it reflective.
-->

# True / False Quiz
<small>Stand, move, or hands-up to vote</small>

<!--
Keep energy high. 1 slide per question.
-->

---

## True or False
AI can think and make decisions like a human.

---

## True or False
Generative AI always gives factually correct answers.

---

## True or False
You need to be a coder to use AI tools at work.

---

## True or False
AI is objective because it’s based on data.

---

## True or False

AI will eventually replace most jobs.

---

## True or False

More data always makes AI smarter

---

## Clarifications

- <span class="fragment">AI recognises patterns; it doesn’t “understand”</span>
- <span class="fragment">Outputs can be wrong or fabricated (hallucinations)</span>
- <span class="fragment">No coding needed for many workplace tools</span>
- <span class="fragment">Bias can enter via data; objectivity not guaranteed</span>

<!--
Anchor each with a simple example. Keep explanations concise.
-->

---

## Pulling It Together

- <span class="fragment">Shared language builds trust and speed</span>
- <span class="fragment">AI is powerful, not magic → human judgment matters</span>
- <span class="fragment">Use decision lenses before deploying AI</span>
- <span class="fragment">Keep explanations simple and clear</span>

<!--
Ask: “What’s one thing you’ll explain differently this week?”
-->

---

## What’s Next

- <span class="fragment">Bring this language into coaching conversations</span>
- <span class="fragment">Practice handling resistance with shared terms</span>
- <span class="fragment">Next session: AI Coaching for Ambassadors</span>
